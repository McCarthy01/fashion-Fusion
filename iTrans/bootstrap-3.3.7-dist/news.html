                <p>It's been 30 solid years since the initiative to create a community where both designers and fashion lovers can meet, interact and get involved in productive business transactions, first came into play.</p>
                <p>The initiative started off as a simple group project during a SheHacksAfrica bootcamp class, and has now become the largest fashion market on the planet.</p>
                <p>As expected, the success the initiative now enjoys had its own fair share of challenges and shortcomings. However, the founders of Fashion Fusion had a clear picture of what they intended for the initiative to grow into, and worked diligently to take the organization to where it is today.</p>
                <p>We'd like to take this moment to thank our partners for their numerous wonderful contributions towards the continuous running and sustainance of the organization. Also, we'd like to thank our thousands of employees for their dedication and commitment towards achieving the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly goals of the organization. Our customers, also, for whom this very organization is built.</p>
